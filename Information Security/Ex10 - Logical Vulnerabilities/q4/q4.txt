Like we saw in the class that app in google.play will be verfied but
actually we will download malicous software, same goes for here, Alice
use data['command'] so she will get the last one related to this, and
Bob use search so he will get the first one related to 'command', because
we know the signature of the command 'echo cool' (we saw in the example
but without it we probably could sniff it by some way) all we need to do
is making Alice check 'echo cool' with it's signature and in the first
argument sending our actually code we want to execute
