First we convert the bytes to bytearray because bytes is immutable
then we replace the 1739 byte in 0xEB value, by ida in the 1739 byte there is
the 'jnz' instruction after the validate function, what this code does it
"put" the value 0xEB instead of jnz,
0xEB is the opcode for 'j' instruction, so no matter the cmp result we always
follow the valid code branch
