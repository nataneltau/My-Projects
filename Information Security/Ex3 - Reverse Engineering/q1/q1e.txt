First we convert the bytes to bytearray because bytes is immutable
then we replace the bytes in offset 1757 - 1761 in the bytes
\xb8\x00\x00\x00\x00
in 1757-1761 bytes by ida
is the 'mov eax, 1' instruction in the invalid code block, what this code
does it "put" b'\xb8\x00\x00\x00\x00' instead of 'mov eax, 1',
this is the opcode for 'mov eax, 0' instruction, so now the program
will always return 0 after the valid function, regardless the validation of the message. 
The printing still unchanged
