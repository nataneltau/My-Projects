Let us mark the number in the first byte of the file as n then 
msgcheck is checking if the xor of the third byte with the constant 0x72 then
it's xor the fourth byte with the previous result, and so on,
it does so n times. at the end we check if the final result is 
equal the second byte, if so the file is valid, else is invalid.
We doing the same logic in the python code, first we check if the file contain more than one
byte, if it's not then there is no second byte and the file is invalid, we return false, else 
we read the first byte and convert it to int, then we run from the third byte leni times (where leni it's the first byte)
and xor the result with the current byte, at the end we return 
True iff the result equal the second byte
