The idea of fixing in this function is: we XOR the data[0] bytes from the third byte
then check if it equal to the second byte i.e. data[1]. so the idea is to change data[0]
to value one so it will only xor the third byte with the const in the program which is 0x72, the
main idea is that we add a byte after the second byte which is the xor result of the second byte
and the const, that way the msgcheck code xor only one block, and the block it xor is the
block we wanted, meaning after the xor we will get back the second byte (as a xor( a xor b ) == b)
and of course it's equal to the second byte so the code of msgcheck will return 0 i.e. valid file
