The idea of fixing in this function is: we XOR the data[0] bytes from the third byte
then check if it equal to the second byte i.e. data[1]. so the idea is to check
what is the result of the XOR and that result write as the second byye, that
way we only change one byte at the file and still making the msgcheck code return 0 i.e. valid file
