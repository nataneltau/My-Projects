The vulnerability is that we again use in strcat but this time there is
no limit on the password length, so if we want to overwrite the function
return address we just need to send the buffer enough data. 
so my solution is just sending big enough string (128) and it's actually
overwrite the return address and created a core dump (i.e. make the program crash).
In addition, I found out that the address of the array is 0xbfffdfc9
and the return address is 67 bytes after that, meaning 0xbfffe00c
