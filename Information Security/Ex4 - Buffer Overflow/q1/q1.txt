The vulnerability is that strcat concatenate string to the buffer until it
get to null terminator (aka '\0'), we can send a password that it's length
is at most 10, but password with length 10 will get us buffer overfllow
and it will overwrite the 'auth' variable, if we want to use it for our 
advantage we need to make sure auth == 1, that can happen by overwrite it with the value 1.

My solution is to send 10 length password that it's last character is the 
character which his ascii value is 1, actually any password with length
10 and last character ascii 1 will work
