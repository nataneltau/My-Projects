First we check if the plain text isn't empty (we dont want divide by zero),
if it is then the score is 0, then we count how much chars in the plain text are English chars and spaces
or different characters or numbers and give them different value,
this sum we divided by the total length of the plain text,
that way we get the precentage of the "Englishness" of the plain text
