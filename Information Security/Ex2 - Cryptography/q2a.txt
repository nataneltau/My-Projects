We doing brute force algorithm, there are 10,000 options to PIN number
so we try them all by encrypt the i'th pin and then check if the encryption is equal the argument we got, if so this is our PIN
and we return it, else we continue to the next optional PIN number,
if we don't find anyone then we return -1 that represent an error
