We check for all posiable keys (which is 2^(8*key_length)) if they can be the possiable key, we doing so by first generating them
from i in the while block, then we try to decrypt the cipher text with that key, if the score of the decrypted plain text is higher
than the current maximum, then he is the new maximum :)
at the end we return the plain text that his score was the biggest
