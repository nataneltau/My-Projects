First we check if the WEBSITE is inside the packet, if not then it's
not our victim website (the one we going to make DoS) retreat. Else
make IP pakcet and exchange the source and destination IP so it will look
like the legit website send it, also make TCP packet with the correct arguments
(like seq number right, ack number right, destination port etc.) in addition
close the connection (put flag as "AF"). At the end create the injected packet
using S.Raw, then unite all this packet and send the united packet. 
Boom we DoS the course website, next target, moodle...
