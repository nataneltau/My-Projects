Just want to said, it was annoying to understand what exactly our ip and mac
next time it would be nice to put a video tutorial :)

is packet ot original gateway function:
We return True iff the source ip and mac is different than ours (we don't
send the packet) and the mac destination is the gateway (meaning we want
to send it to the internet)


create poison function:
In this function we create an ARP packet putting op = 2 (S.ARP.is_at) meaning
we say our ip and mac, and we disguise ourself as the gateway by using 
his IP and our mac address and send it to the machine we want to cheat
using his ip and mac. That way we poison only him 


is stolen packet function:
In this function we return True iff the packet mac destination is our 
mac address and the IP destination is different than ours.
The logic behind this is that whoever send this packet, send it to us
not because it is meant for us but because he thought we are the
gateway... hahaha (imagine evil lough)
