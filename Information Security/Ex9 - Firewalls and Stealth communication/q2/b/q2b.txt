Love the key and IV I choose
winston.py:
First we create AES object with out key and IV, then we pad our message
and encrypt it, we can assume no message is longer than 15 bytes,
after that we send it to julia our love!!!


julia.py:
First we create AES object with out key and IV, then we listen for a 
connection, then read the message we got, decrypt it and remove the 
padding, then return with the message.
