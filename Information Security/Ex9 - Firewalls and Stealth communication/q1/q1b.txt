on_packet function:
Firstwe check if this packet is TCP packet and the flag is syn, so it
may be a stealth syn scan. Then we check if it's the first time we 
see this ip, if so we just add it to the dic, else iterate through all
items in list that relate to ip and check it there are times that are
earlier than WINDOW ago, delete them. At the end add the current time
to the list and update the dict, then check if we recieve syn packet 
from this ip more than 15 times in less than WINDOW, if so block it.


generate_block_command function:
Just return the command we saw in class to add something to iptables
