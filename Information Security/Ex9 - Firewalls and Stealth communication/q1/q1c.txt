The vulnerability in the design is that we block only if we recieve more
than 15 syn packets in 60 seconds, so what the attacker need to do it's
send only 14 packets per minute, as long as he did it he can send it
forever and our firewall will not block it, after some time there will
be too much connections open, we will crush :(
