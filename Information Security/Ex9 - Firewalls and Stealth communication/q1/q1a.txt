generate_syn_packets function:
In this function for all the port in ports list we make a packet with
the desired ip destination and the destination port, with 'S' flag
(syn). this packet we append to the list


analyze_scan function:
First we go through all the packet we recieve answer and was sent to us,
we check what flag it is and add it to dict in accordance, then we go 
through all the packet we sent and don't got answer for and add them to 
the dict as filtered. At the end we return the dict


This is called stealth SYN scan because all we do is sending syn packets 
to some port but we don't intend to really connect to this port, it's 
stealth because not a real connection was create (there wasn't a 3 handshake)
