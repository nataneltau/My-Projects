The vulnerability is that size is unsigned int and it's equal to -1
meaning it's equal to 0xffffffff, in unsigned int it's the maximum value
(something around 4 billion) so we can send message in that size,
which is way bigger than 1024 which is the buffer size, so my solution
is to just send a buffer in size 1424 which seems to overwrite the
return address and made the server crash. 
Also I found out that the buffer start at address 0xbfffdd4c and
the return address at 0xbfffe160-4
