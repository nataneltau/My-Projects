This function is used to concatenate two strings. its received two pointers,
one in EDI and one in ESI. we want to concatenate the string ESI is pointing
to, to the string EDI is pointing to. we do so by making DL equate to zero
(using XOR EDX, EDX), then we travel on the string that EDI pointing to until we
come to a null char ('\0' which his ASCII value is 0) then we start (in _LABEL2)
to concatenate the string ESI is pointing to, to the end of the string EDI pointing
to, char by char, we doing so until the end of ESI string (again until '\0' which equal to zero)
